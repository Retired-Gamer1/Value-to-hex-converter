# Value-to-hex-converter
Version 1 – Official Detailed Release

Hex Generator v1

Hex Generator is an Android application designed to convert values into their ARM machine code (hexadecimal) form.
It was made for both ARM64-v8a and ARMv7a architectures, with a wide range of supported data types and range generation options.

This project was a personal build that sadly didn’t get to 100% completion.
During development, a major, unfixable bug broke the Java source, which meant this build became the only surviving copy.
Some bugs may still exist, so please don’t expect a perfect experience — but I still hope it’s useful to you.
