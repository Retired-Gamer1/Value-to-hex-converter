# Value-to-Hex Converter  
**Version 1 â€“ The Only Surviving Build**  

### A Handy ARM Hex Conversion Tool for Android Modders  

Hex Generator was my passion projectâ€”an Android app designed to simplify converting values into ARM machine code (hexadecimal) for both **ARM64-v8a** and **ARMv7a** architectures. It supports a variety of data types and even includes range generation features, making it useful for game modding, reverse engineering, or low-level tinkering.  

Sadly, development hit a dead end when an unfixable bug corrupted the Java source code. This APK is the last surviving build, warts and all. While itâ€™s not perfect, Iâ€™ve decided to release it in case others find it helpful.

### ðŸ”§ **Features**  
**Supported Architectures:**  
- ARM64-v8a (AArch64)  
- ARMv7a (AArch32)  

**Data Types:**  
- Primitive types: `bool`, `int`, `float`, `short`, `long`, `double`  
- Range generators for: `int`, `float`, `short`, `long`, `double`  

**Use Cases:**  
- Game value modding (e.g., patching memory values)  
- ARM assembly debugging  
- Quick hex reference for common data types

### âš  **Known Issues & Notes**  
- **Double Precision Bug:** Some `double` conversions may produce incorrect hex values. If you encounter this, let me know [@Newbotprexh](https://t.me/retiredgamermods) so I can document it.  
- **Legacy Code:** Since the source is lost, future updates are unlikely unless rewritten from scratch.  
- **No UI Polish:** This was a functional tool firstâ€”donâ€™t expect Material Design!

### ðŸ’¬ **Final Thoughts**  
This project was a learning experience, and while it didnâ€™t reach its full potential, I hope it saves someone time flipping through hex tables. If you find it useful (or spot a bug), Iâ€™d love to hear about it!  

**Note to Modders:** Always verify generated hex values with a disassemblerâ€”ARM alignment and endianness can sometimes trip up automated tools.

This version:  
- Feels more personal and conversational.  
- Explains the context (why the source is lost).  
- Adds practical use cases.  
- Keeps the bug notice but softens the tone.  
- Includes a disclaimer about verification (important for hex tools).
